 Global event script file

 This file allows you to modify how certain events which happen frequently in
 the game on different maps are supposed to be handled. It is a collection of
 script functions which are always called when certain events happen,
 regardless on which map. Script execution is done in the context of the map
 the event happens on.

--]]

-- Register the callback that is called when the hit points of a character
-- reach zero.
on_character_death(function(ch)
    ch:say("Noooooo!!!")
end)

-- This function is called when the player clicks on the OK button after the
-- death message appeared. It should be used to implement the respawn
-- mechanic (for example: warp the character to the respawn location and
-- bring HP above zero in some way)
on_character_death_accept(function(ch)
    -- restores to full hp
    ch:heal()
    -- restores 1 hp (in case you want to be less nice)
    -- ch:heal(1)
    -- warp the character to the respawn location
    ch:warp(1, 815, 100)
end)

-- TODO: All of the below functions are not implemented yet!
--

-- This function is called after chr_death_accept. The difference is that
-- it is called in the context of the map the character is spawned on after
-- the respawn logic has happened.
local function on_chr_respawn(ch)
    -- calls the local_respawn_function of the map the character respawned
    -- on when the script of the map has one
    if local_respawn_function ~= nil then
        local_respawn_function(ch)
    end
end


-- This function is called when a new character enters the world for the
-- first time. This can, for example, be used to give starting equipment
-- to the character and/or initialize a tutorial quest.
local function on_chr_birth(ch)
    -- this message is shown on first login.
    ch:message("And so your adventure begins...")
end

-- This function is called when a character logs into the game. This can,
-- for example, be utilized for a message-of-the-day or for various
-- handlings of offline processing mechanics.
local function on_chr_login(ch)
    ch:message("Welcome to Manasource")
end


-- This function is called when a character is disconnected. This could
-- be useful for various handling of offline processing mechanics.
local function on_chr_logout(ch)
    -- notifies nearby players of logout
    local around = get_beings_in_circle(ch, 1000)
    local msg = ch:name().." left the game."
    for b in pairs(around) do
        if b:type() == TYPE_CHARACTER then
            b:message(msg)
        end
    end
end
